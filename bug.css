The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there might be cases where the browser fails to parse the expression correctly. For example, using spaces inconsistently or missing operators can lead to unexpected results or errors.  Another common issue involves using units inconsistently within the calculation, e.g., mixing `px` and `em` without proper conversion. Incorrect nesting of `calc()` functions can also result in errors. Finally, division by zero is a common error that results in `NaN` or unexpected rendering.
